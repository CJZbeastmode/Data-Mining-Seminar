This paper provides an overview of the support vector machine (SVM) algorithm
and its applications. SVM is a machine learning algorithm that is widely used
for classification and pattern recognition problems. In this paper, a brief
introduction of motive of SVM is given. Then, the mathematical background and
definitions of various concepts within the SVM algorithm are stated. Later on,
we discuss the implementation of SVM in various applications, including image
classification, bioinformatics and so on. Finally, we conclude the paper with
a summary of advantages and disadvantages of SVM.
